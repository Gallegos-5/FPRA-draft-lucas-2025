# Founders’ Promise & American Renewal Act (FPRA)

**A blueprint for citizen-driven, adaptive, and transparent oversight in U.S. governance.**

---

> **Why it matters:**  
> • **Any citizen can trigger a federal audit—no gatekeepers**  
> • **Prevents agency blind spots and emerging-tech risk** (AI, bio, infra, and more are always covered)  
> • **Kills back-room reviews** with a public, cryptographic audit ledger  
> • **Permanent public record**—future oversight builds on real findings, not hidden files  
> • **First national “surge-ready” audit corps**—sector teams, citizen petitions, and open training

## Overview

The **Founders’ Promise & American Renewal Act** (FPRA) establishes a national, surge-ready federal audit corps—adaptable across agencies and new technology. Every audit is logged, hash-chained, and made public. Any citizen (with proof-of-personhood) can trigger a live audit, and all protocols, redactions, and funding are transparent. FPRA is the backbone of trustworthy, learning government.

## What Does FPRA Do?

- **Creates a National Audit Corps:**  
  Sector-based, surge-capable, and always in scope for new agencies or risks.
- **Enables Citizen Audit Petitions:**  
  Any verified citizen can demand a federal audit, with live-stream review and public summary.
- **Cryptographic Audit Ledger:**  
  Every finding, redaction, and protocol update is hash-logged and assigned a DOI.
- **Tiered Audit Protocols:**  
  Critical risks (AI, biotech) use blue-team/red-team drills and rapid-response triggers.
- **Sunset & Review:**  
  Automatic 10-year sunset, mandatory GAO and public review, and “success-dividend” funding.
- **Interagency & State/Tribal MOUs:**  
  Ready for integration with state, tribal, and allied audits.
